        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>Hello! 👋 I'm <span class="highlight">Ganesh Folane</span></h3>

        <p>
            I am a passionate <span class="highlight">BCA second-year student</span> with a strong interest in
            modern software development and cloud-native technologies. I enjoy learning how applications
            are built, deployed, and maintained in real-world environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I am working on <span class="highlight">DevOps tools and technologies</span>,
            where I explore automation, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD),
            containerization, and cloud infrastructure. I aim to understand how development
            and operations come together to create reliable and scalable systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            I strongly believe in learning by doing. I regularly practice, experiment with tools,
            and build projects to strengthen my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to grow as a <span class="highlight">DevOps Engineer and Software Professional</span>,
            contribute to meaningful projects, and continuously adapt to new technologies in the
            ever-evolving tech industry.
        </p>

        <p class="footer-text">
            🚀 Always learning. Always building.
